# Project 4:  Brevet time calculator with Ajax

Reimplement the RUSA ACP controle time calculator with flask and ajax

## ACP controle times

That's "controle" with an 'e', because it's French, although "control"
is also accepted.  Controls are points where   
a rider must obtain proof of passage, and control[e] times are the
minimum and maximum times by which the rider must  
arrive at the location.   

The algorithm for calculating controle times is described at
https://rusa.org/octime_alg.html .  Additional background information
is in https://rusa.org/pages/rulesForRiders . The description is ambiguous,
but the examples help.  Part of finishing this project is clarifying
anything that is not clear about the requirements, and documenting it
clearly.  

We are essentially replacing the calculator at
https://rusa.org/octime_acp.html .  We can also use that calculator
to clarify requirements and develop test data.  

## AJAX and Flask reimplementation

The current RUSA controle time calculator is a Perl script that takes
an HTML form and emits a text page. The reimplementation will fill in
times as the input fields are filled.  Each time a distance is filled
in, the corresponding open and close times should be filled in.   

I will leave much of the design to you.   

## Testing

A suite of nose test cases is a requirement of this project.  Design
the test cases based on an interpretation of rules at
https://rusa.org/octime_alg.html .  Be sure to test your test
cases:  You can use the current brevet time calculator (
https://rusa.org/octime_acp.html ) to check that your expected test
outputs are correct. While checking these values once is a manual
operation, re-running your test cases should be automated in the usual
manner as a Nose test suite.

To make automated testing more practical, your open and close time
calculations should be in a separate module.  Because I want to be 
able to use my test suite as well as yours, I will require that 
module be named acp_times.py and contain the two functions I have 
included in the skeleton code (though revised, of course, to 
return correct results).

With your virtual environment activated, we should be able to run your
test suite by changing to the "brevets" directory and typinng
"nosetests".   All tests should pass.  You should have at least 5
test cases, and more importantly, your test cases should be chosen to
distinguish between an implementation that correctly interprets the
ACP rules and one that does not.

## Replace this README

This README is currently written primarily as instructions to CIS 322
students.  Replace it with a proper README for an ACP time
calculator.  Think about what should be included for users and for
developers.  If it is growing too long, factor details into one or
more separate documents, with references from the README.
